Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The pipeline includes:

Data preprocessing (cleaning + imputation for missing values)

Train/Test split & scaling

Logistic Regression training

Model evaluation (confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

Threshold tuning (best F1-score)

Visualization (ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve, Sigmoid function)

Model saving for reuse
